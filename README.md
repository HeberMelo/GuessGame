This project is a number guessing game in the command line interface (CLI). The objective of the game is for the user to guess a random number between 1 and 100 that has been generated by the computer.Before starting, the user chooses a difficulty level.
Easy: 10 attempts.
Medium:5 attempts.
Hard: 3 attempts.
During the game, the user enters their guesses one by one. After each guess, the program tells them if the number to guess is higher or lower than the entered number. The game ends when the user guesses correctly or runs out of attempts.
